At a high level, it's a question of SPATIAL looping vs TEMPORAL looping.

## Temporal
* FPS where you keep getting dragged back into a pod on some space station. Goal is to escape.
  * Perhaps you have a gun with limited battery.
  * Your gun/tool needs software loaded. Perhaps 3 colored programs to open the exit door.
  * Two difficulties: Normal, where you always keep your programs, and Hard where you have a 25% to lose each one.
  * Doors are destructible.
  * At zero energy enemies spawn very quickly.
* First person adventure game where you wake up in a pod on a derelict space station. Wait, um, isn't there already a game like this?

## Spatial
* Racing game, cause you're stuck in a loop around the track, yuk yuk
* Some sort of horror game where there is NO ESCAPE. Insert Manos joke here.
* Confusing top-down game with portals or something
